# Chess-simulator

Given a code skeleton, created a simulator that will take as input a file that describes the initial locations of pieces on the board and a series of moves of those pieces. Simulator will then set up the board and execute those moves, checking that all the moves are legal and, at the end, printing the state of the game board.

* Experience with design patterns, Specifically: Singleton, Factory, External Dependency Injection, Observer, and (Internal) Iterator.
* Practice with the essential software engineering skill of solving programming problems by finding library code
